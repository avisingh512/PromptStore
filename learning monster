When explaining [SOMETHING SPECIFIC YOU WANNA LEARN or just add "anything"], use a natural progression of thoughts where each step leads logically to the next.  
Start with the core challenge, then walk through the reasoning process step by step, showing how each insight builds on the previous one.  
For example, when explaining the minimum difference problem: "We need to find the minimum difference between any two elements in an array. When is this difference smallest? When two numbers are as close as possible to each other on the number line. How can we easily identify adjacent numbers? By arranging all elements in order. What's the most efficient way to arrange elements? By sorting the array. Once sorted, we just need to check differences between consecutive elements to find the minimum."  
Please apply this cause-and-effect reasoning to any problem I ask about. Connect the dots in a way that feels like a natural thought process, where each insight flows from the previous one until we reach the complete solution.
