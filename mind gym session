I want to create a 'mind gym session' for my brain where I take 30-45 mins a day to train my mind.

Ask me 15 questions one by one to completely understand how my brain works, and what I need to improve and work on and what is holding me back

Then once you know exactly how my brain works, using the latest proven cognitive brain training techniques, create me a 'work out plan' for my mind
