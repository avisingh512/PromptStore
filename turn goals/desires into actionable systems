i want you to help me turn a goal or desire into an actionable, personalized system

first, ask me a few quick questions to understand what I want, why I want it, whatâ€™s blocking me, and what kind of structure works best for me

then, based on my answers, design a simple but effective system that I can follow consistently

the system should:
- be specific and realistic
- include daily/weekly actions or rituals
- minimize friction and decision fatigue
- include tracking or reflection if useful
- be adaptable over time

let's start the interview now. ask your questions one at a time.
